    "Dynamic programming is useful when a problem can be broken down in to subproblems. Let us consider our example. We are starting at the point $\\mathcal{O}\\equiv (0,0)$ and want to find the optimal path to $\\mathcal{N}\\equiv (N-1, N-1)$. We denote this $\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{N}$. Now suppose the shortest path includes the square $\\mathcal{U}_n\\equiv (i_n,j_n)$ as some intermediary point. Then we also know that $\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{U}_n$ is an optimal path.\n",

    "We can describe this in a more concrete way. Suppose the function $F(n,m)$ returns the optimal path to the square indexed by $(n,m)$ and $\\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ is the number of coins on square $(n,m)$. We know that this path must pass through either $(n-1, m)$ or $(n, m-1)$. So, if $F(n,m)$ returns the optimal path. So, we can write $F(n,m)$ recursively:\n",

# RecreationalAnalytics
Welcome! This is a collection of various analytics and data science projects I have done in my free-time for my own amusement and spiritual edification.

The projects are meant to be rather simple. Think along the lines of demonstrations of certain techniques, as opposed to full-fledged, big-data projects. In many cases I am following&mdash;to one degree or another&mdash;a prexisting tutorial. I will provide links to the reference material where appropriate. Feel free to peruse at your leisure! 

# About me
I'm a postdoctoral research associate in the Fundamental Quantum Physics Laboratory at Washington State University. We are studying the behavior of atoms that are so cold they form a new phase of matter, called a Bose-Einstein Condensate (checkout our [website](https://labs.wsu.edu/engels/).) It's pretty cool stuff! And yes, the pun was most definitely intended. 

I earned my doctorate in theoretical physics from Washington State University. My dissertation concerned the scaling behavior of optical nonlinearities, with a focus on novel means of controlling the optical response hybrid quantum systems. This is where I first stumbled upon that most wondrous of man made tools: Python.

I'm currently trying to leverage my background in scientific computing and mathematical modeling to land a position in private industry. This of course entails long hours of practicing all of the wonderful tools in Python and SQL, implementing elements of machine learning and advanced statistics, as well as learning about real-world applications ranging from financial markets to sports.

Wish me luck, and happy travels!

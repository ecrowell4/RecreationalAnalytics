Welcome! This is a collection of various analytics and data science projects I have done in my free-time for my own amusement and spiritual edification.

# About me
I'm a postdoctoral research associate in the Fundamental Quantum Physics Laboratory at Washington State University. We are studying the behavior of atoms that are so cold they form a new phase of matter, called a Bose-Einstein Condensate (checkout our [website](https://labs.wsu.edu/engels/).) It's pretty cool stuff! And yes, the pun was most definitely intended.
